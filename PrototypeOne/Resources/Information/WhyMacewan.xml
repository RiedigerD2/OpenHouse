    <Ratio>0.22222222222</Ratio>
    <Explanation>Faculty members put teaching as their number one priority while actively conducting innovative research projects. They often teach labs (rather than graduate students), allowing students to have good quality instruction and consistency between lectures and labs. MacEwan received a high score (A) for its quality of teaching and learning in The Globe and Mail’s Canadian University Report (2013).

    <Ratio>0.185185</Ratio>
    <Explanation>Class sizes in computer science courses range from 10 (senior-level courses) to 72 (first-year courses). A small class means that you'll get to know your professors and classmates better, and have a better learning experience. You won't be just another face in the crowd.</Explanation>
